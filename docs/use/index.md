## 2. What is XSM, and how do I get it?

XSM is Smilo's native currency. It is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in many Smilo-based applications like the ones above.

The easiest way to get XSM is to buy some. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow you to buy XSM, but the one you should use will depend on where you live and how you want to pay.
