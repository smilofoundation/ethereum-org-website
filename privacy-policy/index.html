Many cookies contain a
so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and
servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the
cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to
differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other
Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet
browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p> <p>Through the use of cookies, the Foundation can provide the users of this
website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible
without the cookie setting.</p> <p>Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our websites
users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to
utilize our websites. The websites user that uses cookies, e.g. does not
have to enter access data each time the websites is accessed, because
this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the
user's computer system.</p> <p>You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our
websites by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser
used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore,
previously set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet
browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular
Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of
cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be possible to use all
the functions of our websites.</p> <p>For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for
which we use them, see our Cookie Policy.</p> <p><strong>3.3 Google Analytics</strong></p> <p>This websites also uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service
provided by Google Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;). Google Inc. is an enterprise of
the holding company Alphabet Inc., domiciled in the USA. The information
generated by the cookie about your use of the websites (including your
IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in
the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of
evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on websites
activity and providing other services relating to websites activity and
internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third
parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data
on behalf of Google.</p> <p>Generally, before the data is transmitted to the provider, the IP
address will be abbreviated by activating IP anonymization (anonymizeIP)
on this website, within the member states of the European Union or in
other contracting states of the agreement on the European Economic Area.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google
server in the USA and abbreviated there. In these cases, we provide
contractual guarantees to ensure that Google Inc. maintains a sufficient
level of data protection. According to Google Inc., under no
circumstances will the IP address be associated with any other
