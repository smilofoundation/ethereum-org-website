  <p>üëã Welcome to smilo.foundation!</p>
</h1>

[smilo.foundation](https://smilo.foundation) is a primary online resource for the Smilo community. It is improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to managing its evolution.

If you‚Äôre interested in helping to improve [smilo.foundation](https://smilo.foundation), start here. This contribution guide will help you get started.

<br>

### Smilo.foundation‚Äôs design and content is guided by three core principles:

**üåè 1. Smilo.foundation is a portal to resources created by the community**

- It will never be ‚Äúencyclopedia smilo‚Äù - we can‚Äôt add every link, or cover every topic
- Rather, its purpose is to direct people to community-built resources
- Smilo.org will always have minimal native-content

**üõ† 2. Smilo.foundation is a work in progress, because Smilo is a work in progress**

- The site has been re-launched explicitly in an unfinished state
- We expect it to change over time, including both content and design
- To accommodate long-term changes, the site has a simple modular structure that will let us add or remove subpages

**ü¶Ñ 3. Smilo.foundation is not a typical product website**

- Smilo.foundation is a representation of our decentralized community, and a starting point for those who want to join it
- Smilo.foundation should not be a traditional product website like every other blockchain. There is no sales pitch.

## How can I contribute?

Keeping in mind the above core principles, there are many ways you can get involved in improving the website!

- Check out the issues page and see if there are any you can help with!
- Submit links to add to specific sections that are incomplete, by submitting a pull-request
- Identify out-of-date information on smilo.foundation (or linked to from smilo.foundation) and submit a pull-request
- Submit new designs for the front-page HERO image - find the specs [here](https://github.com/smilofoundation/smilo-foundation-website/blob/master/smilo.foundation-hero-image-specs.pdf) and contact us at website@smilo.foundation
- Suggest ideas for new subpages, new content, or other ways to improve smilo.foundation by opening an issue.

## Notes on individual sub-pages:

If you want to suggest changes to particular sub-pages, keep in mind the purpose of each page:

### üõ† Developers

- The purpose of this page is to collect core technical resources helpful to someone building on Smilo
- Information should be kept as up to date as possible, as new tools appear, standards are adopted, or material is deprecated
- This page will never be completely comprehensive: the goal is to list the most popular or widely used resources or tools.

Developer tool submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

- Is it meaningfully differentiated from tools already listed?
  - New categories or types of tools
  - New features compared to existing similar tools
  - Targeted at a distinct use-case not covered by existing similar tools
- Is the tool well documented?
  - Does documentation exist?
  - Is it sufficient to use the tool?
  - Has it been recently updated?
- Is the tool widely used?
  - We will consider metrics such as Github stars, download statistics, and whether it is used by known companies or projects.
- Is the tool of sufficient quality?
  - Are there recurring bugs?
  - Is the tool reliable?

### üìö Learn

- The purpose of this page is to collect educational material about Smilo on a variety of topics
- Some information will be technical in nature, but it will also include non-technical information, or articles that may serve as inspiration to community members

### üì± Use

- This page is for the person who wants to get started using Smilo, but doesn‚Äôt know how.
- This page will stay limited to 3 sections: Dapps, Ether, and Wallets.
- Useful contributions include: submitting suggestions for dapps to rotate onto this page, submitting suggestions for better links about Ether or Wallets.
- We will rotate the list of dapps on this page frequently!

Dapp submissions will be assessed on the following criteria:

- Is the dapp a "user" application? This page is targeted at the average user, which means it wouldn't be appropriate to list a dev tool or app targeted at sophisticated technical users.
- Does the application have a good user on-boarding process, such that a user can follow the link, and find all the instructions they need to get started?
- Does the application "round out" the list by adding a new kind of application not already present?
- Is there evidence that the application is popular and well established?

### üëã Beginners

- The purpose of this page is to offer a coherent answer to the most basic questions about Smilo: what is it, and why does it exist?
- Because this page is very simple and does not contain much content, changes to the text will be limited.
- Useful contributions include: suggesting better ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù content to link at the bottom of the page, or suggesting images that could be added to the page to break up the text.

## ü§î How are decisions about the site made?

Decisions about individual PRs, design evolution, and major upgrades to the website are made by a team of people from across the Smilo ecosystem. This team includes project managers, developers, designers, marketing and communications, and subject matter experts. Community input informs every decision: raising questions in issues, submitting PRs, or contacting the team at info@smilo.foundation is helpful!

This team currently includes:

- Anuj Gupta (Smilo Foundation)
- Amanda Gutterman (ConsenSys)
- Hudson Jameson (Smilo Foundation Devops)
- Taeyeon Kim (Smilo Foundation)
- Jamie Pitts (Smilo Foundation Devops)
- Sam Richards (Smilo Foundation)
- Joseph Schweitzer (Smilo Foundation)
- Josh Stark (L4, ETHGlobal, Smilo Foundation)
- Charles St. Louis (MakerDAO & Smilo Cat Herders)
- Evan Van Ness (ConsenSys & Smilo Foundation)
- Alan Woo (Independent designer & developer)
